# <Line Follower Robot University Competition>

## Description

This project was made as an entry to our university's 📟Embedded Systems📟 course competition. The goal of the competition and of this repository was to make a line follower robot🤖 from scratch that can complete all of the 3 stages in the competition.
Moreover this repository also serves as a guide📖 to how you can build our robot, from the components⚙️ you gonna need and the robot's code👨🏻‍💻 to building it and putting it all together. If you wanna build our model or create your own based on our robot then feel free just make sure you give us a mention in your project!! Our main focus📌 for this line follower was for it to be fast⚡️ and able to handle various "weather conditions"☁️ that could be present in the stages along with sharp turns and sudden stops, these factors heavily affected our design and coding decisions as well as which parts we picked.
